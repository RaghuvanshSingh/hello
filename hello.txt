Hello, I am Raghuvansh Singh from India, graduated in Bachelor of Science in I.T.Add commentMore actions
Desite of having a degree, I have no experience in I.T. Although, I practice coding such as Python, Java and SQL.
I was preparing for civil service exam right after my graduation. 
Finally, I have decided to get back myself into I.T. Especially, DATA SCIENCE.
It interests because it gives us tools based on data to predict the future in it's best possible way to read and explore what is and is going to happen based on the real world scenario where Data is everywhere act as an universal identity.
